# LYIT-Machine-Learning-Project

## CA 2 Machine Learning Project

### Authors: Ultan Kearns & Liam Millar

## Explanation of Repository

The aim of this project is to train a model using a dataset to analyze patterns which lead breast cancer to being malignant and / or benign.  We also aim to provide a comprehensive research paper detailing the purpose, methodology and applications of our finished model.

## Structure of Repository

* CA3MachineLearning -> Contains the .tex files and .bib files for our research paper
* CA3MachineLearning.pdf -> PDF generated from .tex files
* wdbcwh.csv -> csv of full dataset with headers


## About this project

This project was coded in python utilizing various libraries for machine learning and data-science
